dedupv1_debug

The dedupv1_debug application is used to inspect the dedupv1 system while the daemon is not started.

The current implementation starts the complete system internally, so that in fact there is no
advantage compared to starting the daemon and using the inspect monitor.

In future versions, the dedupv1_debug application should be modified to a) not start the whole
system and b) also start if parts of the system are not runnable, e.g. due to a inconsistent state.
