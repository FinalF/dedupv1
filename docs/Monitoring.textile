dedupv1 contains a runtime monitoring system to allow the administrators to inspect certain aspects of the system.
All monitoring components can be accessed via:
<code>
    $DEDUPV1_ROOT/bin/dedupv1_mon [--port=<port>] <monitor> [<option-name>=<option>]*
 </code>

dedupv1_mon must be called from the root user on the local machine. 

At least the following monitors are usually active by default:

 * monitor - Gives a list of all installed monitors
 * stats - General statistics about the system incl. amount of stored and deduplicated data
 * status - Current status of the system, e.g. ok or shutting down
 * profile - Profiling information
 * config - Prints out the current configuration of the system

Besides the monitoring system, the dedupv1 system writes log files. By default, the log file is written
 to /opt/dedupv1/var/log/dedupv1/. The log settings can be changed in the log settings file /opt/dedupv1/etc/dedupv1/logging.xml.
