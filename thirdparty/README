This directory contains several thirdparty libraries used by the dedupv1 project.

The libraries have seperated licenses that can be found in the source archives. The patches contained
in this directory modified the libraries to that they work in the environment. The patch files
are licenses under and appropriate license for the modified library.

Note:
 - All used libraries must be licensed under terms that allow the development and distribution of closed
   source software, e.g. BSD or LPGL.
 - If a new major library is added or the version of an already used library is updated, 
   the dedupv1/version.h file and the installation scripts should be updated.
 - SCST is GPL software: So it is not possible to overtake any code. However, opening /dev/scst_user
   should not force dedupv1 under GPL terms.
